# Shop Model Scene

Welcome to the Shop Model Scene Lighting Setup project! This repository contains a Unity scene that requires lighting and reflection adjustments to achieve a high-quality look while ensuring optimization.

## Task Description

The goal of this task is to work on the lighting and reflections of the shop model scene. By implementing your own lighting setup, you will enhance the overall visual quality of the scene. It is essential to strike a balance between aesthetics and performance optimization.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the project by either cloning this repository or downloading the ZIP archive.
1. Open the project in Unity by launching the Unity editor and selecting "Open Project." Browse to the downloaded project folder and select it.
1. Once the project is open, locate the shop model scene you need to work on.

## Lighting Setup Instructions

To set up the lighting and reflections for the scene, please follow these guidelines:

1. Clear the baked data: Before implementing your own lighting setup, make sure to clear any existing baked lighting data in the scene. This step ensures a clean slate for your adjustments.
1. Implement your own lighting setup: Analyze the scene and determine the appropriate lighting setup to achieve the desired high-quality look. Experiment with different light sources, intensities, and colors to create the desired atmosphere.
1. Optimize performance: While working on the lighting setup, consider the optimization of the scene. Strive to maintain a balance between visual quality and performance to ensure smooth real-time rendering.
1. Reflection adjustments: Pay attention to the reflections within the scene. Adjust reflection probes and materials as necessary to enhance the realism and visual appeal.
1. Post-processing package: If needed, you may utilize the post-processing package available in Unity. Explore the various options and effects it offers to further enhance the scene's overall appearance.
